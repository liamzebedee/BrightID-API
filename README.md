APIs allow applications to connect to [BrightID](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID) to verify that their users are unique.

## Mobile API
Applications interface with BrightID Mobile on the same device through the Mobile API to retrieve the public key associated with a user.

## Node API
[BrightID nodes](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID-Node) return the _trust score_ associated with a public key obtained through the mobile API.  The trust score represents a user's likelihood of being unique.  The API connects automatically to several nodes to retrieve an accurate score by consensus.

## How it Works
[BrightID nodes](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID-Node) store connections between users, forming a social graph. Nodes analyze the graph and assign users _trust scores_. When an application wants to know whether a user is a unique individual in their system, they make a request to a BrightID node.

BrightID nodes protect systems against fake or duplicate accounts, known as _sybils_.
