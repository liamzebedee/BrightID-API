Brightside is a decentralized service that allows applications to verify that their users are unique.

This is important to a variety of applications, including basic income, voting, reputation systems, and charities.

## Components
### Interaction Client
The Brightside interaction client runs on mobile devices and registers face-to-face interactions. These interactions form the basis for establishing someone's uniqueness.

Individuals use the interaction client to grant third-party applications the right to verify their uniqueness.

[Read more about the Interaction client in the wiki](https://github.com/adamstallard/brightside/wiki/Interaction-Client)
### Interaction API
Third-party applications interface with the Brightside interaction client running on the same device to retrieve a public key associated with the user.
### Uniqueness Verification Service
An application pushes a public key obtained through the interaction API to one or more Brightside nodes, which then perform a verification check and publish the result.

## How it Works
Brightside nodes store interactions, forming a social graph. By analyzing this graph, a node is able to determine whether or not a person can be verified as unique. When another application--such as a Basic Income application--wants to know whether a user is a unique individual in their system, they make a request to a Brightside node. Brightside nodes also protect systems against fake or duplicate accounts, known as _sybils_. Node operators may earn money for their services.
