BrightID Service is an API that works with [BrightID](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID) to provide a way for applications to verify that their users are unique.

This is important to universal basic income, voting, rating systems, referrals, and giveaways.

## Components
### [BrightID Mobile](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID)
BrightID mobile registers real-world interactions. These form the basis for establishing someone's uniqueness.

BrightID mobile users grant third-party applications the right to verify their uniqueness.

### Included With BrightID Service
#### Mobile API
Applications interface with BrightID Mobile on the same device to retrieve a public key associated with the user.
#### Uniqueness API
An application pushes a public key obtained through the interaction API to one or more [BrightID nodes](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID-Node), which then perform a verification check and publish the result.

## How it Works
[BrightID nodes](https://github.com/BrightID/BrightID-Node) store interactions, forming a social graph. By analyzing this graph, a node is able to determine whether or not a person can be verified as unique. When another application wants to know whether a user is a unique individual in their system, they make a request to a BrightID node.

BrightID nodes protect systems against fake or duplicate accounts, known as _sybils_.

Node operators may earn money for their services.
